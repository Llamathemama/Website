    <h1>Raihan Jaffer</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Raihan Jaffer. I am a high school student with a passion for technology, creativity, and helping others. I enjoy coding and creative ventures. I also follow developments in aerospace engineering. I've never held many official leadership titles and have little accomplishments.</p>
    <p>Despite that, a few accomplishments I am proud of are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning to code on my own</li>
      <li>Shook hands with Mayor Scarpitti and helped break ground at Aanin Community Center</li>
      <li>Maintained decent academic performance throughout high school</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although I haven’t officially been in leadership positions, I have often had to make decisions by circumstance.</p>

    <h1>Leadership Positions</h1>
    <h2>BOH4M1</h2>
    <p>Some positions that I have been in over the years that may count as leadership positions include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Teaching my friend how to code</li>
      <li>Helped organize a school event</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have found myself in more <i>"lowkey"</i> leadership positions over the years.</p>
